Autotools skeleton
-----------------

A simple autotools skeleton for quickly setting up new projects


Requirements
------------

* Automake
* Autoconf
* Libtool

Simple steps to create a new autotools project
----------------------------------------------

1) Clone the repository

2) Give it a quick try:

        ~# bash autogen.sh
        ~# cd build/
        ~# ../configure
        ~# make
        ~# ./src/my_program
        ~# make check
        ~# make install
        ~# my_program
        ~# make uninstall

3) Remove `.git/` folder

4) Change parameters in `configure.ac`, specially `AC_INIT()` ones

5) Import your code, setup your favourite revision control system and start customizing the configure.ac and Makefile.am(s) for your project structure...

have fun!

FAQ
---

* _I get an error after modifying the structure of my project, what shall I do?_

  Try re-running autogen.sh first. If this doesn't help you most likely have a misconfiguration.

* _Once I do `make install`, `my_program` is not in the path or I cannot link against `libmy_lib.so/a`_.

  This skeleton installs by default binaries in `/usr/local/bin`, and libraries in `/usr/local/lib`. Make sure they are on the path and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

TODO
----

* Add `--enable-feature-x` and `--with-feature-y` switch cases in configure.ac
* Add library checks at configure time
* Add custom `config.h.in`
